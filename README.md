A tiny Python script to help you figure out what time to clock out after starting your workday â€” based on a standard 8-hour schedule (with lunch breaks).

You input the time you clocked in, and the script tells you exactly when to clock out to complete a full 8-hour workday.

$ python ClockOutTime.py

Enter the clock-in time (HH:MM AM/PM): 7:28 AM
Enter the clock-out for lunch time (HH:MM AM/PM): 11:34 AM
Enter the clock-in after lunch time (HH:MM AM/PM): 12:04 PM
You need to clock out at: 03:58 PM
Press enter to exit
